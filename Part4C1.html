		<p class="first"> You question Jamie on his own. </p>
		
		<p class="second"> It is discovered that Jamie has depression and has tablets for his condition. </p>
		
		<p class="third"> You get a sense that these tablets may be the same ones that were found empty within Donalds room. </p>
		
		<p class="fourth"> As you mention to Jamie about these tablets as foul play he becomes very uncomfortable.</p>
