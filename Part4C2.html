		<h1> Part Four - Option Two</h1>
		
		<p class="first"> You question Andrew solo. </p>
		
		<p class="second"> Andrew is asked if Jamie had anything to do with his father death. </p>
		
		<p class="third"> He then starts to ramble on about how neither of them did. </p>
		
		<p class="fourth"> By saying this it makes you feel a connection between them two and Donalds passing. </p>
		
		<p class="fifth"> You ask Andrew if they both had a good relationship with their father.</p>
		
		<p class="sixth"> A delayed response shows he had to think about this and makes you sense a disconnection with their late father.</p>
